[ ] wide = 1 run (wide) + 1-4 runs (extra wides)
    - Wides are recorded as a negative statistic in a bowler's record.
    - If batsman takes additional runs, they are scored as wides, not byes. These extra wides are all added to the bowler's score.
    - If the ball travels all the way to the boundary, the batting team immediately scores five wides.
    - If the ball crosses the boundary without touching the ground, only five wides (not seven) are scored.

[ ] nb = 1 run + 1-6 runs
    - If the batsman hits the ball and takes runs, these are scored as runs by the batsman.
    - Runs may also be scored without the batsman hitting the ball, but these are recorded as No ball extras rather than byes or leg byes.

[ ] lb = 1-6 runs
    - Runs scored are scored as leg byes, and they are added to the team's total, but not to the batsman, nor to the bowler.
    - In case of a boundary, the batting team immediately scores four leg byes.

[ ] b = 1-4 runs
    - Runs are added to the team's total, but not to the batsman.
    - In case of boundary, it recorded as four byes (even if it does not hit the ground).
    - byes are considered to be the fault of the wicket-keeper, and are considered negatively against the wicket-keeper's record.


No Ball:
    - no run
